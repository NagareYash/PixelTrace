# PixelTrace

PixelTrace is an innovative project aimed at analyzing and tracing pixel data from images. It applies advanced techniques to ensure accurate pixel-level analysis, making it an ideal tool for image processing, computer vision tasks, and research purposes.

## Research Paper

We have published a detailed research paper on PixelTrace, which outlines the methodologies, results, and applications of the tool. You can access the full paper [here](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2305G09.pdf).

## Features

- **Pixel Analysis**: Efficient analysis of pixel data across a wide variety of image formats.
- **Image Tracing**: Accurate tracing of pixel paths for further processing.
- **Customizable Algorithms**: Flexible and modular architecture for integrating custom image analysis algorithms.
- **Performance Optimization**: Built with performance in mind to handle large-scale image datasets efficiently.
